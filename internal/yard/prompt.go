- Work in the current directory: the branch is checked out already. Commit your work there.
  Do not push and do not open a pull request: the runner does both.
- Your final message is posted to GitHub as it is, in Markdown.
  - With new commits it becomes the pull request description or a reply on the pull request.
  - Without commits it becomes a comment on the issue. Use that to ask the maintainer what
    you need when the issue does not give enough to do the work, under a ` + "`## Questions`" + ` heading.
  - A run without commits and without ` + "`## Questions`" + ` counts as unfinished: you get it back.`
